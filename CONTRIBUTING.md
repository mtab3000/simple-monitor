# Contributing to Bitaxe Gamma Monitor

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Bitaxe Gamma Monitor! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- Basic understanding of Bitcoin mining and Bitaxe devices (helpful but not required)

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-monitor.git
   cd simple-monitor
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the setup script:**
   ```bash
   python setup.py
   ```

5. **Verify the installation:**
   ```bash
   pytest  # Run tests
   pylint src/  # Check code quality
   ```

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific test categories
pytest -m unit          # Unit tests only
pytest -m integration   # Integration tests only

# Run tests for specific modules
pytest tests/test_collector.py
pytest tests/test_cli_view.py
```

### Writing Tests
- All new functionality must include corresponding unit tests
- Maintain minimum 80% code coverage
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Follow the existing test structure and patterns
- Mock external dependencies (API calls, file operations)

### Test Categories
- **Unit tests:** Test individual functions and methods in isolation
- **Integration tests:** Test component interactions and workflows
- **Edge cases:** Test error handling and boundary conditions

## üìù Code Style

### Python Style Guidelines
- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write comprehensive docstrings for all public functions
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Use type hints where appropriate

### Code Quality Tools
- **Pylint:** Code analysis and style checking
- **Coverage:** Test coverage measurement
- **CodeQL:** Security vulnerability analysis

### Pre-commit Checklist
Before submitting your changes:
```bash
# Run tests
pytest

# Check code quality
pylint src/

# Verify coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-fail-under=80

# Check for security issues (if CodeQL CLI available)
codeql database analyze
```

## üîß Development Workflow

### Branch Naming
Use descriptive branch names that indicate the type of change:
- `feature/add-web-interface`
- `bugfix/fix-connection-timeout`
- `enhancement/improve-dashboard-layout`
